Every summer, my family would drive to the lake house where my uncle taught us how to fish from the old wooden dock that extended into Lake Erie.
I was always fascinated by how the fish swarmed around our feet, and I would spend hours watching the water, hoping to see the fish swim by.
I was never a good swimmer, but my uncle would always tell me to jump off the dock and swim to the other end. He would say, “Just go for it!” and he would jump in after me.
One summer, I was determined to learn how to swim, and I would spend hours practicing in our pool at home. I was getting closer and closer to being able to swim, and I was so proud of my progress. I would always tell my uncle how I was doing, and he would always encourage me to keep trying.
One summer, I finally felt like I was ready to jump into Lake Michigan and try to make it to the shore.
I was nervous, but my uncle was there to help me, and I knew I could make the distance. As soon as I jumped in, I felt the coldness of the lake and the current pulling at my legs. I was determined to make it to shore and I kept swimming, even though I was getting more and more exhausted. I could see the beach getting closer, and I knew I could make the distance. Finally I made it to shore, and I was exhausted but so proud that I had made it.
I was so happy that my uncle had been there with me to help me, and he was proud too.
I had learned how important having someone there to help me and support my efforts had made all of the difference. It was a lesson that I have carried throughout my life, and I am so grateful to have had the chance.
My uncle’s words, “Go for It!” have always stuck with me. I have used that advice to help motivate me in all of my endeavors, whether it’s trying something new, taking a chance, and pushing myself to do better.
I am so grateful to have had my uncle there with us, and I am proud to say that I am now a strong swimmer and have made the journey to shore countless of times. I am so grateful for the lessons I have learned from him, as well as the memories we made together.
